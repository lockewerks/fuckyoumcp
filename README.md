# fuckyoumcp

The Windows 11 system MCP server that every other MCP server wishes it was.

**98 tools. 19 categories. 41 direct Win32 syscalls. Sub-millisecond response times. Full autonomous computer use.** Built in Rust because we're not here to fuck around with Node.js startup times and PowerShell's "please wait while I load the entire .NET runtime to tell you what your CPU is called."

## Fair Warning

> **This tool gives an AI full, unrestricted, root-level access to your Windows machine.** It can kill processes, rewrite your registry, delete files, create users, modify firewall rules, disable services, and now — see your screen, move your mouse, and type on your keyboard. It will do exactly what you tell it to, and if what you tell it is stupid, it will do that too. Enthusiastically.
>
> This is not a toy. This is not a sandbox. There is no safety net, no "are you sure?" prompt, no undo button. If you don't understand what `RegDeleteKeyW` does, or why giving an AI `SendInput` access is a spectacularly bad idea in the wrong hands — **this is not for you.** Go install something with guardrails and a friendly UI. We hear VS Code has a nice plugin marketplace.
>
> If you *do* understand the risks and you're here anyway: welcome. You're our kind of unhinged.

## What the hell is this?

An [MCP (Model Context Protocol)](https://modelcontextprotocol.io) server that gives AI assistants **full system control** over Windows 11. Not just system management — **full autonomous computer use**. Screen capture, mouse control, keyboard input, plus processes, services, registry, firewall, network, the whole goddamn operating system.

Other Windows MCP servers use PowerShell for everything and make you wait 1-2 seconds per tool call. We call Win32 APIs directly from Rust. Our `process_list` runs in **9ms**. Our `memory_info` runs in **<1ms**. Their equivalent takes **1,500ms**. Do the math.

**Native Win32 tools (41):** Process management, services, registry, filesystem, network connections, system info, clipboard, disk info, **screen capture, mouse control, keyboard input** — all via direct syscalls. No subprocess. No serialization overhead. Just raw speed.

**PowerShell pool tools (57):** Firewall rules, scheduled tasks, event logs, user management, Windows features, audio, updates — stuck behind COM/WMI interfaces that only PowerShell can reach without losing your mind. The pool keeps 3 `pwsh.exe` processes warm so at least you're not paying startup cost.

### Computer Use — Full Autonomous Desktop Control

The computer use tools let an AI assistant **see and interact with your desktop** like a human would. All native Win32, no PowerShell overhead:

- **`screen_capture`** — Screenshot the full screen or a specific region. Returns PNG image via MCP image content. Uses GDI BitBlt for capture, PNG encoding for transport.
- **`cursor_position`** — Get the current mouse cursor X,Y coordinates.
- **`mouse_move`** — Glide the cursor to any screen coordinate with smooth eased movement.
- **`mouse_click`** — Glide to position, then left/right/middle click, single/double/triple. Uses SendInput for reliable injection.
- **`mouse_scroll`** — Glide to position, then scroll wheel up or down.
- **`mouse_drag`** — Glide to start point, hold button, glide to end point, release. Smooth eased interpolation throughout.
- **`keyboard_type`** — Type arbitrary Unicode text (emoji, CJK, accented chars, anything) via KEYEVENTF_UNICODE. Works regardless of keyboard layout.
- **`keyboard_key`** — Press key combos: `ctrl+c`, `alt+tab`, `win+d`, `shift+f5`, `enter`, etc. Handles modifier hold/release sequences automatically.

All mouse movements use **ease-in-out cubic interpolation** — the cursor accelerates from rest, cruises, then decelerates to a stop. Duration scales with distance (60ms for short hops, up to 600ms for cross-screen sweeps). No teleporting. Watching the cursor glide on its own is either mesmerizing or deeply unsettling depending on your relationship with the machine.

## Installation

### Prerequisites

- **Windows 11** (or 10, but why are you still on 10?)
- **PowerShell 7+** (`winget install Microsoft.PowerShell`)
- **Rust** (`winget install Rustlang.Rustup`) — only needed to build from source

### Build from source

```bash
git clone https://github.com/lockewerks/fuckyoumcp.git
cd fuckyoumcp
cargo build --release
```

Your binary is at `target/release/fuckyoumcp.exe` (4.3MB, stripped, LTO'd).

### Add to your MCP client

Most MCP clients use a JSON config file. Add fuckyoumcp as a server:

**Settings file** (e.g. `settings.json`, `mcp_config.json`, etc.):

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "fuckyoumcp": {
      "command": "C:\\path\\to\\fuckyoumcp.exe"
    }
  }
}
```

### Desktop app config

For desktop MCP apps, the config is usually at `%APPDATA%\<app>\config.json`:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "fuckyoumcp": {
      "command": "C:\\path\\to\\fuckyoumcp.exe"
    }
  }
}
```

## Monitoring

Every tool call is logged to `%TEMP%\fuckyoumcp.log` with timestamps, tool names, execution times, and error details.

```powershell
# Watch it live
Get-Content -Path "$env:TEMP\fuckyoumcp.log" -Wait -Tail 20
```

```bash
# Or from Git Bash / WSL
tail -f $TEMP/fuckyoumcp.log
```

Sample output:
```
0.532ms  INFO ▶ native tool="process_list"
0.541ms  INFO ✓ native done tool="process_list" ms=9 bytes=1277
1.200ms  INFO ▶ call tool="eventlog_query"
2.450ms  INFO ✓ done tool="eventlog_query" ms=1250 bytes=8432
```

## Configuration

| Env Variable | Default | Description |
|-------------|---------|-------------|
| `FYMCP_POOL_SIZE` | `3` | Number of persistent PowerShell workers |
| `RUST_LOG` | `info` | Log level (`debug`, `info`, `warn`, `error`) |

## Performance

Measured on AMD Ryzen AI 9 HX 370, Windows 11 Pro:

| Tool | Backend | Latency |
|------|---------|---------|
| `memory_info` | Native Win32 | **<1ms** |
| `system_info` | Native Win32 | **<1ms** |
| `disk_info` | Native Win32 | **<1ms** |
| `service_list` | Native Win32 | **4ms** |
| `process_list` | Native Win32 | **9ms** |
| `cpu_info` | PowerShell | ~1,100ms |
| `eventlog_query` | PowerShell | ~1,250ms |
| `firewall_rules_list` | PowerShell | ~1,500ms |

Native tools are **100-1000x faster** than PowerShell-backed tools. The 41 native tools cover the most commonly used operations plus full computer use. The 57 PowerShell tools handle the COM/WMI-only operations that would require 10x the code to implement natively.

## Why "fuckyoumcp"?

Because we looked at the existing Windows MCP landscape and said exactly that. Every other server was either:

- **UI automation** (cool, but we want system control *and* screen control)
- **PowerShell wrappers** that spawn a new `pwsh.exe` for every. single. command.
- **TypeScript** servers adding 200ms of Node.js startup to every interaction

So we wrote it in Rust with direct Win32 syscalls because we have standards and those standards include sub-millisecond response times. Then we added native computer use tools because why should your AI have to choose between system control and desktop interaction?

## Contributing

PRs welcome. If you want to migrate one of the 57 PowerShell tools to native Win32, you are a hero and we will buy you a beer. If you want to add a new tool, go for it — just put it in the right category in `server.rs` and it'll get picked up by the tool router automatically.
